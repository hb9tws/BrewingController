BrewingController
-----------------

This is a small demo project for a universal app that can run on a Raspberry Pi. The project 
can be used to brew some beer in a multi rest mashing processes. 

The mashing temperature is measured with a DS1821 or DS18B20 sensor. The sensor is connected
to the Raspberry Pi via an I2C-1Wire bridge running on an ATTiny45 micro controller. The BrewingController
controls a heating device.

In addition the BrewingController can also be used to control  the fermentation temperature.

Have fun and enjoy your own beer!
